# Comparing Multiple Measures in Views

Challenge: I'm preparing a report for management. They want to see how the sales forecast compares to actual sales. In this hands-on-activity, I have built a combined axis chart to answer the question: 
### How does Budget Sales compare to actual Sales over the last few years?

# Using Scatter Plots To Show Relationships Between Measures

Challenge: I have been asked to create a view for my company that compares average sales with average marketing expenses, broken down by product type, state, and area code, to see if there is a relationship. I have built a scatter plot to answer this question: 
### What is the relationship between average marketing expenses and average sales?

# Creating Spreadsheet-like Views Using Text Tables

Challenge: I have been asked to create a text table that shows the average sales for each product within my company’s three departments across four sales regions. This will help users determine: 
### Which region has the highest average sales for each product within each category and sub-category?

# Showing Breakdowns of the Whole Using Pie Charts
Challenge: I have sales data that I want to present using two pie charts, one showing sales by customer segment and one showing sales by region. 
### I used two different methods to create my charts.

# Showing Breakdowns of the Whole Using Tree Maps
Challenge: I'm looking at my organization’s sales data, and I want to see the relative contribution of each product category and region to your total sales. T
### To determine this, I built a tree map.

# Using Bar-in-Bar Charts and Bullet Graphs to Compare Measures
Challenge 1: I have sales data for office products. To compare 2018 and 2019 sales for product category and sub-category
### I have built a bar-in-bar chart that shows 2018 sales as a small bar on top of 2019 sales as a larger bar.<br>
Challenge 2: Using data about coffee and product sales, I wanted to compare the actual sales to projected sales, and I wanted to see sales as a bar over distribution areas marking 50%, 75% and 100% points. 
### I added a line to mark the quota (projected sales), and used color to show whether a product met quota.

# Creating Symbol and Filled Maps
Challenge:I'm working with passenger data for European airports, and I’d like to determine which airports were the busiest during a span of time. 
### Using the three-character IATA airport industry codes, I created a symbol map of the airport data, using size and color to compare the number of passengers for each airport in 2021. I limited map clutter by leveraging tooltips and removing unnecessary map layers. I added a filter to the view to help show which airports were the busiest.

# Creating a Density Map
Challenge:I'm working with a data set of hail storm damage reported in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and I’d like to identify the neighborhoods with the most reported storm damage. 
### I created a density map of the street address locations of the reported hail storm damage, adjusted the combination of Color, Intensity, and Size to make the trends more apparent.

# Working with String and Type Conversion Functions
Challenge: I have data that contains information about students. You would like to create a field, Student Name and ID that contains: 
* The student’s last name in all capitals
* The student’s first initial
* The student’s ID
* A comma and space after the last name, a period and space after the first initial, and the fixed string "ID:" and a space before the ID number. 
For example, for the student Glen Adams, ID# 596, you would like the data to display as follows: <br>

ADAMS, G. ID: 596<br>
